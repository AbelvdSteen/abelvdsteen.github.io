      <p class="display-3 text-center">About Me <br/></p>
      <p class="text-white lead playFadeIn"><br/>I am a second-year software development student at SintLucas. Games, technology and websites have always been a 
        life-long passion of mine, and I am wholeheartedly excited to finally be working in the industry.
      </p>

      <p class="display-6">What kind of developer am I?</p>
      <p>While I do have experience with frontend web development and a slight amount with backend, my
        main strength currently lies in C# / Unity. I've already made a handful of small games and websites, so be sure to check those out
        down below.
        <br>
        <br>As for Game Development, the big reason I started this education is because I wanted the knowledge to be able to make my <em>dream game.</em>
        Sadly, I don't have that many ideas for such a game yet, and I still have <em>much</em> more to learn before I want to even think of starting
        on a project like that. I'm ready to learn though, one step at a time!
        <br>Aside from all the coding stuff, I consider myself a very creative person: I can draw, play a few instrument and produce music!
        It's not what this portfolio is about of course, but if you're looking for a more all-round developer you got the right guy.

                <p>“A delayed game will eventually be good, but this quote is really overused stop saying this every time a game is delayed
                  yet still releases unapologetically bad.
                  What was I saying?” 
                  – Shigeru Miyamoto</p>
                <p>This was my attempt at making a JRPG Battle System, and suffice to say: I bit off more than I could chew at that point. 
                  I only had half a year of programming experience and greatly underestimated how much coding goes into a simple turn-based 
                  battle system, but it does a good job at showing my strengths and weaknesses. While being a practically impossible task at 
                  the time, I still made sure to think ahead on all the placeholders and mechanics so I could still turn it into something 
                  better if I needed to. The block and flee buttons don’t work, and there is no start- or end-screen, so while I missed a lot 
                  of goals I wanted to reach, I definitely learned a lot from my mistakes.</p>
                <p>The assignment was themed around ambition, and I think I at least hit that mark with this basic game. I love turn-based 
                  RPGs and can say with zero doubt I will attempt this endeavor again in the future, so I’m excited to see my improvement 
                  over the years!</p>

                    <p>The game features a fully complete menu, featuring both a level select screen leading to two complete levels and a small tutorial screen.
                      Both levels' music was used with full permission, the first even being made by myself. Since then, I've already improved my composition skills,

                    <p>The game features two complete levels, each carefully made to match the song's beat. You're able to hit and miss each beat, and you get more points
                      based on how close to the center of the beat you were. There is also a score and max combo counter in the bottom left of the screen to see how you're doing.

                      hesitation if you want to stop the game.

                      This "goal" is pretty redundant, but it's the only objective in the game besides beating someone else's score. In the end screen, you can see exactly
                      how many notes you missed, hit, how well you hit them, etc.

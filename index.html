      <p class="display-3 text-center">About Me</p>
      <p class="text-white text-center lead">To repeat what was stated before: Hello! I am Abel van der Steen, am 17 years old, from
        the Netherlands and am a second-year Software Development student. Games, technology and websites have always been a 
        life-long passion of mine, and I am wholeheartedly excited to finally be working in the industry!
      </p>

      <p class="display-5 text-center">What kind of developer am I?</p>
      <p class="text-center">While I do have experience with frontend web development and a slight amount with backend, my
        main strength currently lies in C# / Unity. Of course, web development is still a big strength too! (It's what the people want, right?)
        one thing you should probably keep me away from is back-end web development... I have a bad relationship with PHP.
        <br>
        <br>As for Game Development, the big reason I started this education is because I wanted the knowledge to be able to make my <em>dream game.</em>
        Sadly, I don't have that many ideas for such a game yet, and I still have <em>much</em> more to learn before I want to even think of starting
        on a project like that. I'm ready to learn, one step at a time!
        <br>Aside from all the coding stuff, I consider myself a very creative person: I can draw, play a few instrument and produce music!
        More on that later, but of course it's not the main focus of this website ;)

                <p>Novaflow is a Guitar Hero / Friday Night Funkin' inspired rhythm game made by myself for SintLucas' SHINE project.
                  The game challenged me in both code and Unity itself, and I learned a lot from it. The SHINE project's goal was to show your
                  growth in the year, and I think I hit the mark with <em>Novaflow.</em>

                <p>For SintLucas' Ambition Project, I attempted to make a JRPG-like turn-based battle system. Suffice to say: I bit off
                  more than I could chew! I made a lot of planning and programming mistakes, which led me to make something I'm not
                  exactly proud of, but it was a valuable learning experience!

            <p>This Guitar Hero / Friday Night Funkin’ inspired rhythm game made on my own really captivates what I learned during my first 
              year of being a software dev student, challenging me with not just programming but with Unity itself. The game features two 
              complete levels (one not being finished on time for the deadline) and all other things you might expect in a game like a 
              tutorial screen and a stats display at the end of each level. And yes, I did get permission to use the levels’ music! 
              (I even made the medium one myself)</p>
            <p>The SHINE-project’s purpose was to show your progress and what you learned in order to make something you can be proud of, 
              and I definitely hit that mark. I’m excited to see what projects the future hold, and am 100% ready to work hard and achieve

                <p>“A delayed game will eventually be good, but this quote is really overused stop saying this every time a game is delayed.
                  What was I saying?” 
                  – Shigeru Miyamoto</p>
                <p>This was my attempt at making a JRPG Battle System, and suffice to say: I bit off more than I could chew at that point. 
                  I only had half a year of programming experience and greatly underestimated how much coding goes into a simple turn-based 
                  battle system, but it does a good job at showing my strengths and weaknesses. While being a practically impossible task at 
                  the time, I still made sure to think ahead on all the placeholders and mechanics so I could still turn it into something 
                  better if I needed to. The block and flee buttons don’t work, and there is no start- or end-screen, so while I missed a lot 
                  of goals I wanted to reach, I definitely learned a lot from my mistakes.</p>
                <p>The assignment was themed around ambition, and I think I at least hit that mark with this basic game. I love turn-based 
                  RPGs and can say with zero doubt I will attempt this endeavor again in the future, so I’m excited to see my improvement 
                  over the years!</p>
